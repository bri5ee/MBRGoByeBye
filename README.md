MBR Go Bye Bye is a simple C# program utilizing P-Invoke to use unmanaged code and call for the CreateFile and WriteFile functions to overwrite the Master Boot Record ("MBR"). Also tried to add in a message when the FATAL error message appears but this is a work in progress. (Check out https://github.com/SleepMod/Overwrite-MBR/blob/master/mbr-source.asm to see how the byte array was generated).
